v1.3 28th May 2012
  - Bug fixes.

v1.2 25th May 2012
  - Updated the project file format to v2.
  - Move the header file scanner and parser functionality to a separate tool
    with a more obvious user interface.
  - The workflow now supports working on multiple versions of a library at the
    same time (rather than assuming the latest versions was always being worked
    on).
  - The assumption that the header files reside in the same header directory
    for all versions has been removed.

v1.1 5th May 2012
  - The logger is now a separate dock window.
  - Added the ability to verify the format of a project file against a formal
    XML schema definition.
  - The XML format of a project and the internal implementation are now fully
    documented.
  - Much refactoring to make it much easier to change the format of a project
    file and to implement tools to upgrade from older formats.

v1.0 9th April 2012
  - The first public release.
