Need feedback when the scanning of a header directory is complete.
Adjust the column widths so that "Name" takes all available space by default.
Consider splitting the main tree - maybe header directories go in a dock, maybe
modules go into separate tabs (with the aim of maximising the screen space
available when working on a module).
Redesign the dialogs so that they look better under OS/X.
Make sure any function in the context menu is also available on the main menu.
Add the ability to annotate everything.
Add support for dragging multiple items (particularly Unknown -> Ignored).
Auto-scroll the tree widget when dragging (as Qt3 used to do).
Looks like tool tips no longer work for code items.
The API editor doesn't receive notifications when a version is renamed.
